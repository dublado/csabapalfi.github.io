title: "Have you pushed any public commits to github today?"

## UPDATE

Github fixed this and now allows [publicizing anonymized private contributions on your profile](https://help.github.com/articles/publicizing-or-hiding-your-private-contributions-on-your-profile/).

## The good

I love the github **contribution chart** on profile pages. It gives visual feedback and it's a great feeling to watch your streak going on for days. Or weeks! You should [push code every day, right](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/)? There are even [bathroom tiles with that](https://twitter.com/mrdougal/statuses/442929113733410816) :)

## The bad

The problem is that they **don't provide an accurate view** of your **public activity** if you're lucky enough that your company/client also uses github as their source control or you have private repos. If you couldn't care less about that -which is perfectly understandable- please stop reading now.

Ever noticed the little lock in the top right corner of the chart? Hover over it and see: your public profile might not look as good as what you see when you're logged in. Just open your github profile in Chrome incognito mode to see what everyone else does.
